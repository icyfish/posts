## Host and DNS

**host**: many processes

Your Request Goes:

your host -> destination network -> destination host(within the network) -> destination process

www.google.com - IP address (Network ID and Host ID and Port Numbers)

NID to reach network
HID to reach host
Port(process number) to reach process

default Port Number:
HTTP-80
FTP-21
SMTP-25

ISP: provide DNS

**DNS overhead?**

## binary numbers

- unary number system: only one symbol: 0
- decimal number system: 0 - 9 
- binary number system: 0, 1
- octal number system: 0 - 7
- hexadecimal number system: 0 - 9 & A - F

2^10 = 1024(K)
2^20 (M)
2^30 (G)
2^40 (T)

1 bit: 2 = 2^1 binary numbers are possible ()
2 bits: 4 = 2^2
3 bits: 8 = 2^3

how many parts will i be dividing the entire space into
